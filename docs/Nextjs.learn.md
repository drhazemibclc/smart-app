This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## Folder and file conventions

### Top-level folders

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

|                                                                    |                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |

| [`src`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder)       | Optional application source folder |

### Top-level files

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run proxy, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

### Routing Files

Add `page` to expose a route, `layout` for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, `loading` for skeletons, `error` for error boundaries, and `route` for APIs.

|                                                                               |                     |                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [`layout`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout)                   | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Layout                       |
| [`page`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)                       | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Page                         |

| [`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)             | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Not found UI                 |
| [`error`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)                     | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Error UI                     |

### Nested routes

Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists.

| Path                        | URL pattern     | Notes                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `app/layout.tsx`            | —               | Root layout wraps all routes  |
| `app/blog/layout.tsx`       | —               | Wraps `/blog` and descendants |
| `app/page.tsx`              | `/`             | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/page.tsx`         | `/blog`         | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/authors/page.tsx` | `/blog/authors` | Public route                  |

### Dynamic routes

Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use `[segment]` for a single param, `[...segment]` for catch‑all, and `[[...segment]]` for optional catch‑all. Access values via the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop.

| Path                            | URL pattern                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`      | `/blog/my-first-post`                                                |
| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx`   | `/shop/clothing`, `/shop/clothing/shirts`                            |
| `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` | `/docs`, `/docs/layouts-and-pages`, `/docs/api-reference/use-router` |

### Route groups and private folders

Organize code without changing URLs with route groups [`(group)`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups#convention), and colocate non-routable files with private folders [`_folder`](#private-folders).

| Path                            | URL pattern | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`      | `/`         | Group omitted from URL                    |
| `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`      | `/cart`     | Share layouts within `(shop)`             |
| `app/blog/_components/Post.tsx` | —           | Not routable; safe place for UI utilities |
| `app/blog/_lib/data.ts`         | —           | Not routable; safe place for utils        |

### Parallel and Intercepted Routes

These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use `@slot` for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

| Pattern (docs)                                                                              | Meaning              | Typical use case                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`@folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#slots)                 | Named slot           | Sidebar + main content                   |
| [`(.)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)      | Intercept same level | Preview sibling route in a modal         |
| [`(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)     | Intercept parent     | Open a child of the parent as an overlay |
| [`(..)(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention) | Intercept two levels | Deeply nested overlay                    |
| [`(...)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)    | Intercept from root  | Show arbitrary route in current view     |

## Organizing your project

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### Component hierarchy

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

* `layout.js`
* `template.js`
* `error.js` (React error boundary)
* `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
* `not-found.js` (React error boundary for "not found" UI)
* `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

### Colocation

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-not-routable.png)

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-routable.png)

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-colocation.png)

> **Good to know**: While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](#store-project-files-outside-of-app).

### Private folders

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

![An example folder structure using private folders](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-private-folders.png)

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#colocation), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

* Separating UI logic from routing logic.
* Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
* Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
* Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
> * You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
> * If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.

### Route groups

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

![An example folder structure using route groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-route-groups.png)

Route groups are useful for:

* Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
* Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  * [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
  * [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

### `src` folder

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

![An example folder structure with the src folder](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-src-directory.png)

## Examples

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-project-root.png)

### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.

![An example folder structure with project files inside app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root.png)

### Split project files by feature or route

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root-split.png)

### Organize routes without affecting the URL path

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-organisation.png)

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-layouts.png)

### Opting specific segments into a layout

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png)

### Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route

To apply a [loading skeleton](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-loading.png)

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### Creating multiple root layouts

To create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png)

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.

# Layouts and Pages
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


Next.js uses **file-system based routing**, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes. This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.

## Creating a page

A **page** is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a [`page` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) inside the `app` directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (`/`):

![page.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/page-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
```

## Creating a layout

A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a [`layout` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout). The component should accept a `children` prop which can be a page or another [layout](#nesting-layouts).

For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a `layout` file inside the `app` directory:

![layout.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/layout-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Layout UI */}
        {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Layout UI */}
        {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

The layout above is called a [root layout](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout) because it's defined at the root of the `app` directory. The root layout is **required** and must contain `html` and `body` tags.

## Creating a nested route

A nested route is a route composed of multiple URL segments. For example, the `/blog/[slug]` route is composed of three segments:

* `/` (Root Segment)
* `blog` (Segment)
* `[slug]` (Leaf Segment)

In Next.js:

* **Folders** are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
* **Files** (like `page` and `layout`) are used to create UI that is shown for a segment.

To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, to add a route for `/blog`, create a folder called `blog` in the `app` directory. Then, to make `/blog` publicly accessible, add a `page.tsx` file:

![File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/blog-nested-route.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
// Dummy imports
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from '@/ui/post'

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
// Dummy imports
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from '@/ui/post'

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

You can continue nesting folders to create nested routes. For example, to create a route for a specific blog post, create a new `[slug]` folder inside `blog` and add a `page` file:

![File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/blog-post-nested-route.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
function generateStaticParams() {}

export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
function generateStaticParams() {}

export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
```

Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. `[slug]`) creates a [dynamic route segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) which is used to generate multiple pages from data. e.g. blog posts, product pages, etc.

## Nesting layouts

By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout` inside specific route segments (folders).

For example, to create a layout for the `/blog` route, add a new `layout` file inside the `blog` folder.

![File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-layouts.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function BlogLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/layout.js" switcher
export default function BlogLayout({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`app/layout.js`) would wrap the blog layout (`app/blog/layout.js`), which would wrap the blog (`app/blog/page.js`) and blog post page (`app/blog/[slug]/page.js`).

## Creating a dynamic segment

[Dynamic segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) allow you to create routes that are generated from data. For example, instead of manually creating a route for each individual blog post, you can create a dynamic segment to generate the routes based on blog post data.

To create a dynamic segment, wrap the segment (folder) name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`. For example, in the `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` route, the `[slug]` is the dynamic segment.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function BlogPostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = await getPost(slug)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export default async function BlogPostPage({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = await getPost(slug)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Learn more about [Dynamic Segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) and the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) props.

Nested [layouts within Dynamic Segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#params-optional), can also access the `params` props.

## Rendering with search params

In a Server Component **page**, you can access search parameters using the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const filters = (await searchParams).filters
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.jsx" switcher
export default async function Page({ searchParams }) {
  const filters = (await searchParams).filters
}
```

Using `searchParams` opts your page into [**dynamic rendering**](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering) because it requires an incoming request to read the search parameters from.

Client Components can read search params using the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook.

Learn more about `useSearchParams` in [statically rendered](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#static-rendering) and [dynamically rendered](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#dynamic-rendering) routes.

### What to use and when

* Use the `searchParams` prop when you need search parameters to **load data for the page** (e.g. pagination, filtering from a database).
* Use `useSearchParams` when search parameters are used **only on the client** (e.g. filtering a list already loaded via props).
* As a small optimization, you can use `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` in **callbacks or event handlers** to read search params without triggering re-renders.

## Linking between pages

You can use the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) to navigate between routes. `<Link>` is a built-in Next.js component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide [prefetching](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#prefetching) and [client-side navigation](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#client-side-transitions).

For example, to generate a list of blog posts, import `<Link>` from `next/link` and pass a `href` prop to the component:

```tsx filename="app/ui/post.tsx" highlight={1,10} switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function Post({ post }) {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/post.js" highlight={1,10}  switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function Post({ post }) {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**: `<Link>` is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js. You can also use the [`useRouter` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more advanced navigation.

## Route Props Helpers

Next.js exposes utility types that infer `params` and named slots from your route structure:

* [**PageProps**](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#page-props-helper): Props for `page` components, including `params` and `searchParams`.
* [**LayoutProps**](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#layout-props-helper): Props for `layout` components, including `children` and any named slots (e.g. folders like `@analytics`).

These are globally available helpers, generated when running either `next dev`, `next build` or [`next typegen`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-typegen-options).

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx"
export default async function Page(props: PageProps<'/blog/[slug]'>) {
  const { slug } = await props.params
  return <h1>Blog post: {slug}</h1>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx"
export default function Layout(props: LayoutProps<'/dashboard'>) {
  return (
    <section>
      {props.children}
      {/* If you have app/dashboard/@analytics, it appears as a typed slot: */}
      {/* {props.analytics} */}
    </section>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**
>
> * Static routes resolve `params` to `{}`.
> * `PageProps`, `LayoutProps` are global helpers — no imports required.
> * Types are generated during `next dev`, `next build` or `next typegen`.

# Linking and Navigating
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


In Next.js, routes are rendered on the server by default. This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. Next.js comes with built-in [prefetching](#prefetching), [streaming](#streaming), and [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions) ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.

This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for [dynamic routes](#dynamic-routes-without-loadingtsx) and [slow networks](#slow-networks).

## How navigation works

To understand how navigation works in Next.js, it helps to be familiar with the following concepts:

* [Server Rendering](#server-rendering)
* [Prefetching](#prefetching)
* [Streaming](#streaming)
* [Client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions)

### Server Rendering

In Next.js, [Layouts and Pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the [Server Component Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#how-do-server-and-client-components-work-in-nextjs) is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering, based on *when* it happens:

* **Static Rendering (or Prerendering)** happens at build time or during [revalidation](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating) and the result is cached.
* **Dynamic Rendering** happens at request time in response to a client request.

The trade-off of server rendering is that the client must wait for the server to respond before the new route can be shown. Next.js addresses this delay by [prefetching](#prefetching) routes the user is likely to visit and performing [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions).

> **Good to know**: HTML is also generated for the initial visit.

### Prefetching

Prefetching is the process of loading a route in the background before the user navigates to it. This makes navigation between routes in your application feel instant, because by the time a user clicks on a link, the data to render the next route is already available client side.

Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) when they enter the user's viewport.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:

* **Static Route**: the full route is prefetched.
* **Dynamic Route**: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if [`loading.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) is present.

By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

![Server Rendering without Streaming](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png)

To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use [streaming](#streaming).

### Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.

For dynamic routes, it means they can be **partially prefetched**. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the `page.tsx` contents in a `<Suspense>` boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.

> **Good to know**: You can also use [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to create loading UI for nested components.

Benefits of `loading.tsx`:

* Immediate navigation and visual feedback for the user.
* Shared layouts remain interactive and navigation is interruptible.
* Improved Core Web Vitals: [TTFB](https://web.dev/articles/ttfb), [FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), and [TTI](https://web.dev/articles/tti).

To further improve the navigation experience, Next.js performs a [client-side transition](#client-side-transitions) with the `<Link>` component.

### Client-side transitions

Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.

Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the `<Link>` component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:

* Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
* Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.

Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps *feel* like client-rendered apps. And when paired with [prefetching](#prefetching) and [streaming](#streaming), it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.

## What can make transitions slow?

These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still *feel* slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

### Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`

When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

> **Good to know**: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See [`devIndicators`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators) for more information.

### Dynamic segments without `generateStaticParams`

If a [dynamic segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params), the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.

Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding `generateStaticParams`:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

### Slow networks

On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the `loading.js` fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.

To improve perceived performance, you can use the [`useLinkStatus` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status) to show immediate feedback while the transition is in progress.

```tsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

You can "debounce" the hint by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay. See the [`useLinkStatus` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status#gracefully-handling-fast-navigation) for a CSS example.

> **Good to know**: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example [here](https://github.com/vercel/react-transition-progress).

### Disabling prefetching

You can opt out of prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false` on the `<Link>` component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).

```tsx
<Link prefetch={false} href="/blog">
  Blog
</Link>
```

However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:

* **Static routes** will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.
* **Dynamic routes** will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.

To reduce resource usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more *likely* to visit, rather than all links in the viewport.

```tsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.js" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({ href, children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

### Hydration not completed

`<Link>` is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.

React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:

* Using the [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling#nextbundle-analyzer-for-webpack) plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.
* Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) docs for guidance.

## Examples

### Native History API

Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).

#### `window.history.pushState`

Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### `window.history.replaceState`

Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale: string) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.js" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}

# Server and Client Components
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


By default, layouts and pages are [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), which lets you fetch data and render parts of your UI on the server, optionally cache the result, and stream it to the client. When you need interactivity or browser APIs, you can use [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to layer in functionality.

This page explains how Server and Client Components work in Next.js and when to use them, with examples of how to compose them together in your application.

## When to use Server and Client Components?

The client and server environments have different capabilities. Server and Client components allow you to run logic in each environment depending on your use case.

Use **Client Components** when you need:

* [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) and [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events). E.g. `onClick`, `onChange`.
* [Lifecycle logic](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects). E.g. `useEffect`.
* Browser-only APIs. E.g. `localStorage`, `window`, `Navigator.geolocation`, etc.
* [Custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

Use **Server Components** when you need:

* Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
* Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.
* Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
* Improve the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/), and stream content progressively to the client.

For example, the `<Page>` component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the `<LikeButton>` which handles client-side interactivity.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,17} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

## How do Server and Client Components work in Next.js?

### On the server

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments ([layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages)):

* **Server Components** are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
* **Client Components** and the RSC Payload are used to [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching#rendering-strategies) HTML.

> **What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?**
>
> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:
>
> * The rendered result of Server Components
> * Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
> * Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component

### On the client (first load)

Then, on the client:

1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

> **What is hydration?**
>
> Hydration is React's process for attaching [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.

### Subsequent Navigations

On subsequent navigations:

* The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
* **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.

## Examples

### Using Client Components

You can create a Client Component by adding the [`"use client"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) directive at the top of the file, above your imports.

```tsx filename="app/ui/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`"use client"` is used to declare a **boundary** between the Server and Client module graphs (trees).

Once a file is marked with `"use client"`, **all its imports and child components are considered part of the client bundle**. This means you don't need to add the directive to every component that is intended for the client.

### Reducing JS bundle size

To reduce the size of your client JavaScript bundles, add `'use client'` to specific interactive components instead of marking large parts of your UI as Client Components.

For example, the `<Layout>` component contains mostly static elements like a logo and navigation links, but includes an interactive search bar. `<Search />` is interactive and needs to be a Client Component, however, the rest of the layout can remain a Server Component.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/search.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/search.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

### Passing data from Server to Client Components

You can pass data from Server Components to Client Components using props.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,7} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can stream data from a Server Component to a Client Component with the [`use` API](https://react.dev/reference/react/use). See an [example](/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#streaming-data-with-the-use-api).

> **Good to know**: Props passed to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.

### Interleaving Server and Client Components

You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component. This allows you to visually nest server-rendered UI within Client components.

A common pattern is to use `children` to create a *slot* in a `<ClientComponent>`. For example, a `<Cart>` component that fetches data on the server, inside a `<Modal>` component that uses client state to toggle visibility.

```tsx filename="app/ui/modal.tsx" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/modal.js" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

Then, in a parent Server Component (e.g.`<Page>`), you can pass a `<Cart>` as the child of the `<Modal>`:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"  highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

In this pattern, all Server Components will be rendered on the server ahead of time, including those as props. The resulting RSC payload will contain references of where Client Components should be rendered within the component tree.

### Context providers

[React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is commonly used to share global state like the current theme. However, React context is not supported in Server Components.

To use context, create a Client Component that accepts `children`:

```tsx filename="app/theme-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/theme-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

Then, import it into a Server Component (e.g. `layout`):

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider, and all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.

> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.

### Sharing data with context and React.cache

You can share fetched data across both Server and Client Components by combining [`React.cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) with context providers.

Create a cached function that fetches data:

```ts filename="app/lib/user.ts" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
  return res.json()
})
```

```js filename="app/lib/user.js" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
  return res.json()
})
```

Create a context provider that stores the promise:

```tsx filename="app/user-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

type User = {
  id: string
  name: string
}

export const UserContext = createContext<Promise<User> | null>(null)

export default function UserProvider({
  children,
  userPromise,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  userPromise: Promise<User>
}) {
  return <UserContext value={userPromise}>{children}</UserContext>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/user-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const UserContext = createContext(null)

export default function UserProvider({ children, userPromise }) {
  return <UserContext value={userPromise}>{children}</UserContext>
}
```

In a layout, pass the promise to the provider without awaiting:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import UserProvider from './user-provider'
import { getUser } from './lib/user'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const userPromise = getUser() // Don't await

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <UserProvider userPromise={userPromise}>{children}</UserProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import UserProvider from './user-provider'
import { getUser } from './lib/user'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  const userPromise = getUser() // Don't await

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <UserProvider userPromise={userPromise}>{children}</UserProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Client Components use [`use()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) to resolve the promise from context, wrapped in `<Suspense>` for fallback UI:

```tsx filename="app/ui/profile.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { use, useContext } from 'react'
import { UserContext } from '../user-provider'

export function Profile() {
  const userPromise = useContext(UserContext)
  if (!userPromise) {
    throw new Error('useContext must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  const user = use(userPromise)
  return <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/profile.js" switcher
'use client'

import { use, useContext } from 'react'
import { UserContext } from '../user-provider'

export function Profile() {
  const userPromise = useContext(UserContext)
  if (!userPromise) {
    throw new Error('useContext must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  const user = use(userPromise)
  return <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Profile } from './ui/profile'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Profile } from './ui/profile'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Server Components can also call `getUser()` directly:

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/page.tsx" switcher
import { getUser } from '../lib/user'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await getUser() // Cached - same request, no duplicate fetch
  return <h1>Dashboard for {user.name}</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/page.js" switcher
import { getUser } from '../lib/user'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await getUser() // Cached - same request, no duplicate fetch
  return <h1>Dashboard for {user.name}</h1>
}
```

Since `getUser` is wrapped with `React.cache`, multiple calls within the same request return the same memoized result, whether called directly in Server Components or resolved via context in Client Components.

> **Good to know**: `React.cache` is scoped to the current request only. Each request gets its own memoization scope with no sharing between requests.

### Third-party components

When using a third-party component that relies on client-only features, you can wrap it in a Client Component to ensure it works as expected.

For example, the `<Carousel />` can be imported from the `acme-carousel` package. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `"use client"` directive.

If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:

```tsx filename="app/gallery.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/gallery.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error. This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.

To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:

```tsx filename="app/carousel.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

```jsx filename="app/carousel.js" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

> **Advice for Library Authors**
>
> If you’re building a component library, add the `"use client"` directive to entry points that rely on client-only features. This lets your users import components into Server Components without needing to create wrappers.
>
> It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `"use client"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `"use client"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.

### Preventing environment poisoning

JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules. This means it's possible to accidentally import server-only code into the client. For example, consider the following function:

```ts filename="lib/data.ts" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

```js filename="lib/data.js" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

This function contains an `API_KEY` that should never be exposed to the client.

In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are included in the client bundle. If variables are not prefixed, Next.js replaces them with an empty string.

As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected.

To prevent accidental usage in Client Components, you can use the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only).

Then, import the package into a file that contains server-only code:

```js filename="lib/data.js"
import 'server-only'

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

Now, if you try to import the module into a Client Component, there will be a build-time error.

The corresponding [`client-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-only) can be used to mark modules that contain client-only logic like code that accesses the `window` object.

In Next.js, installing `server-only` or `client-only` is **optional**. However, if your linting rules flag extraneous dependencies, you may install them to avoid issues.

```bash package="npm"
npm install server-only
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add server-only
```

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add server-only
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add server-only
```

Next.js handles `server-only` and `client-only` imports internally to provide clearer error messages when a module is used in the wrong environment. The contents of these packages from NPM are not used by Next.js.

Next.js also provides its own type declarations for `server-only` and `client-only`, for TypeScript configurations where [`noUncheckedSideEffectImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports) is active.

***********### Error Handling************
# Error Handling
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


Errors can be divided into two categories: [expected errors](#handling-expected-errors) and [uncaught exceptions](#handling-uncaught-exceptions). This page will walk you through how you can handle these errors in your Next.js application.

## Handling expected errors

Expected errors are those that can occur during the normal operation of the application, such as those from [server-side form validation](/docs/app/guides/forms) or failed requests. These errors should be handled explicitly and returned to the client.

### Server Functions

You can use the [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) hook to handle expected errors in [Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions).

For these errors, avoid using `try`/`catch` blocks and throw errors. Instead, model expected errors as return values.

```ts filename="app/actions.ts" switcher
'use server'

export async function createPost(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')

  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/posts', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: { title, content },
  })
  const json = await res.json()

  if (!res.ok) {
    return { message: 'Failed to create post' }
  }
}
```

```js filename="app/actions.js" switcher
'use server'

export async function createPost(prevState, formData) {
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')

  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/posts', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: { title, content },
  })
  const json = await res.json()

  if (!res.ok) {
    return { message: 'Failed to create post' }
  }
}
```

You can pass your action to the `useActionState` hook and use the returned `state` to display an error message.

```tsx filename="app/ui/form.tsx" highlight={11,19} switcher
'use client'

import { useActionState } from 'react'
import { createPost } from '@/app/actions'

const initialState = {
  message: '',
}

export function Form() {
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createPost, initialState)

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <label htmlFor="title">Title</label>
      <input type="text" id="title" name="title" required />
      <label htmlFor="content">Content</label>
      <textarea id="content" name="content" required />
      {state?.message && <p aria-live="polite">{state.message}</p>}
      <button disabled={pending}>Create Post</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/form.js" highlight={11,19} switcher
'use client'

import { useActionState } from 'react'
import { createPost } from '@/app/actions'

const initialState = {
  message: '',
}

export function Form() {
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createPost, initialState)

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <label htmlFor="title">Title</label>
      <input type="text" id="title" name="title" required />
      <label htmlFor="content">Content</label>
      <textarea id="content" name="content" required />
      {state?.message && <p aria-live="polite">{state.message}</p>}
      <button disabled={pending}>Create Post</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Server Components

When fetching data inside of a Server Component, you can use the response to conditionally render an error message or [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect).

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)
  const data = await res.json()

  if (!res.ok) {
    return 'There was an error.'
  }

  return '...'
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)
  const data = await res.json()

  if (!res.ok) {
    return 'There was an error.'
  }

  return '...'
}
```

### Not found

You can call the [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) function within a route segment and use the [`not-found.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) file to show a 404 UI.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
import { getPostBySlug } from '@/lib/posts'

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = getPostBySlug(slug)

  if (!post) {
    notFound()
  }

  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
import { getPostBySlug } from '@/lib/posts'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = getPostBySlug(slug)

  if (!post) {
    notFound()
  }

  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/not-found.tsx" switcher
export default function NotFound() {
  return <div>404 - Page Not Found</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/not-found.js" switcher
export default function NotFound() {
  return <div>404 - Page Not Found</div>
}
```

## Handling uncaught exceptions

Uncaught exceptions are unexpected errors that indicate bugs or issues that should not occur during the normal flow of your application. These should be handled by throwing errors, which will then be caught by error boundaries.

### Nested error boundaries

Next.js uses error boundaries to handle uncaught exceptions. Error boundaries catch errors in their child components and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

Create an error boundary by adding an [`error.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error) file inside a route segment and exporting a React component:

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/error.tsx" switcher
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function ErrorPage({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error(error)
  }, [error])

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        onClick={
          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
          () => reset()
        }
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/error.js" switcher
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function ErrorPage({ error, reset }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error(error)
  }, [error])

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        onClick={
          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
          () => reset()
        }
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Errors will bubble up to the nearest parent error boundary. This allows for granular error handling by placing `error.tsx` files at different levels in the [route hierarchy](/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#component-hierarchy).

![Nested Error Component Hierarchy](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-error-component-hierarchy.png)

Error boundaries don’t catch errors inside event handlers. They’re designed to catch errors [during rendering](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror) to show a **fallback UI** instead of crashing the whole app.

In general, errors in event handlers or async code aren’t handled by error boundaries because they run after rendering.

To handle these cases, catch the error manually and store it using `useState` or `useReducer`, then update the UI to inform the user.

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export function Button() {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

  const handleClick = () => {
    try {
      // do some work that might fail
      throw new Error('Exception')
    } catch (reason) {
      setError(reason)
    }
  }

  if (error) {
    /* render fallback UI */
  }

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  )
}
```

Note that unhandled errors inside `startTransition` from `useTransition`, will bubble up to the nearest error boundary.

```tsx
'use client'

import { useTransition } from 'react'

export function Button() {
  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition()

  const handleClick = () =>
    startTransition(() => {
      throw new Error('Exception')
    })

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Global errors

While less common, you can handle errors in the root layout using the [`global-error.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error#global-error) file, located in the root app directory, even when leveraging [internationalization](/docs/app/guides/internationalization). Global error UI must define its own `<html>` and `<body>` tags, since it is replacing the root layout or template when active.

```tsx filename="app/global-error.tsx" switcher
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components

export default function GlobalError({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  return (
    // global-error must include html and body tags
    <html>
      <body>
        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/global-error.js" switcher
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components

export default function GlobalError({ error, reset }) {
  return (
    // global-error must include html and body tags
    <html>
      <body>
        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Cache Components
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


> **Good to know:** Cache Components is an opt-in feature. Enable it by setting the `cacheComponents` flag to `true` in your Next config file. See [Enabling Cache Components](#enabling-cache-components) for more details.

Cache Components lets you mix static, cached, and dynamic content in a single route, giving you the speed of static sites with the flexibility of dynamic rendering.

Server-rendered applications typically force a choice between static pages (fast but stale) and dynamic pages (fresh but slow). Moving this work to the client trades server load for larger bundles and slower initial rendering.

Cache Components eliminates these tradeoffs by prerendering routes into a **static HTML shell** that's immediately sent to the browser, with dynamic content updating the UI as it becomes ready.

![Partially re-rendered Product Page showing static nav and product information, and dynamic cart and recommended products](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/light/thinking-in-ppr.png)

## How rendering works with Cache Components

At build time, Next.js renders your route's component tree. As long as components don't access network resources, certain system APIs, or require an incoming request to render, their output is **automatically added to the static shell**. Otherwise, you must choose how to handle them:

* Defer rendering to request time by wrapping components in React's [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), [showing fallback UI](#defer-rendering-to-request-time) until the content is ready, or
* Cache the result using the [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) directive to [include it in the static shell](#using-use-cache) (if no request data is needed)

Because this happens ahead of time, before a request arrives, we refer to it as prerendering. This generates a static shell consisting of HTML for initial page loads and a serialized [RSC Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#on-the-server) for client-side navigation, ensuring the browser receives fully rendered content instantly whether users navigate directly to the URL or transition from another page.

Next.js requires you to explicitly handle components that can't complete during prerendering. If they aren't wrapped in `<Suspense>` or marked with `use cache`, you'll see an [`Uncached data was accessed outside of <Suspense>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/blocking-route) error during development and build time.

> **Good to know**: Caching can be applied at the component or function level, while fallback UI can be defined around any subtree, which means you can compose static, cached, and dynamic content within a single route.

![Diagram showing partially rendered page on the client, with loading UI for chunks that are being streamed.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

This rendering approach is called **Partial Prerendering**, and it's the default behavior with Cache Components. For the rest of this document, we simply refer to it as "prerendering" which can produce a partial or complete output.

> **🎥 Watch:** Why Partial Prerendering and how it works → [YouTube (10 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTcPrTIBkpA).

## Automatically prerendered content

Operations like synchronous I/O, module imports, and pure computations can complete during prerendering. Components using only these operations have their rendered output included in the static HTML shell.

Because all operations in the `Page` component below complete during rendering, its rendered output is automatically included in the static shell. When both the layout and page prerender successfully, the entire route is the static shell.

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import fs from 'node:fs'

export default async function Page() {
  // Synchronous file system read
  const content = fs.readFileSync('./config.json', 'utf-8')

  // Module imports
  const constants = await import('./constants.json')

  // Pure computations
  const processed = JSON.parse(content).items.map((item) => item.value * 2)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{constants.appName}</h1>
      <ul>
        {processed.map((value, i) => (
          <li key={i}>{value}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**: You can verify that a route was fully prerendered by checking the build output summary. Alternatively, see what content was added to the static shell of any page by viewing the page source in your browser.

## Defer rendering to request time

During prerendering, when Next.js encounters work it can't complete (like network requests, accessing request data, or async operations), it requires you to explicitly handle it. To defer rendering to request time, a parent component must provide fallback UI using a Suspense boundary. The fallback becomes part of the static shell while the actual content resolves at request time.

Place Suspense boundaries as close as possible to the components that need them. This maximizes the amount of content in the static shell, since everything outside the boundary can still prerender normally.

> **Good to know**: With Suspense boundaries, multiple dynamic sections can render in parallel rather than blocking each other, reducing total load time.

### Dynamic content

External systems provide content asynchronously, which often takes an unpredictable time to resolve and may even fail. This is why prerendering doesn't execute them automatically.

In general, when you need the latest data from the source on each request (like real-time feeds or personalized content), defer rendering by providing fallback UI with a Suspense boundary.

For example, the `DynamicContent` component below uses multiple operations that are not automatically prerendered.

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import fs from 'node:fs/promises'

async function DynamicContent() {
  // Network request
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')

  // Database query
  const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users')

  // Async file system operation
  const file = await fs.readFile('..', 'utf-8')

  // Simulating external system delay
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100))

  return <div>Not in the static shell</div>
}
```

To use `DynamicContent` within a page, wrap it in `<Suspense>` to define fallback UI:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
export default async function Page(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Part of the static shell</h1>
      {/* <p>Loading..</p> is part of the static shell */}
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading..</p>}>
        <DynamicContent />
        <div>Sibling excluded from static shell</div>
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

Prerendering stops at the `fetch` request. The request itself is not started, and any code after it is not executed.

The fallback (`<p>Loading...</p>`) is included in the static shell, while the component's content streams at request time.

In this example, since all operations (network request, database query, file read, and timeout) run sequentially within the same component, the content won't appear until they all complete.

> **Good to know**: For dynamic content that doesn't change frequently, you can use `use cache` to include the dynamic data in the static shell instead of streaming it. See the [during prerendering](#during-prerendering) section for an example.

### Runtime data

A specific type of dynamic data that requires request context, only available when a user makes a request.

* [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) - User's cookie data
* [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) - Request headers
* [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) - URL query parameters
* [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) - Dynamic route parameters (unless at least one sample is provided via [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params)). See [Dynamic Routes with Cache Components](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes#with-cache-components) for detailed patterns.

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

async function RuntimeData({ searchParams }) {
  // Accessing request data
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  const headerStore = await headers()
  const search = await searchParams

  return <div>Not in the static shell</div>
}
```

To use the `RuntimeData` component, wrap it in a `<Suspense>` boundary:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
export default async function Page(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Part of the static shell</h1>
      {/* <p>Loading..</p> is part of the static shell */}
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading..</p>}>
        <RuntimeData searchParams={props.searchParams} />
        <div>Sibling excluded from static shell</div>
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

Use [`connection()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection) if you need to defer to request time without accessing any of the runtime APIs above.

> **Good to know**: Runtime data cannot be cached with `use cache` because it requires request context. Components that access runtime APIs must always be wrapped in `<Suspense>`. However, you can extract values from runtime data and pass them as arguments to cached functions. See the [with runtime data](#with-runtime-data) section for an example.

One approach for reading runtime data like cookies without blocking the static shell is to pass a promise to a client context provider. See [Sharing data with context and React.cache](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#sharing-data-with-context-and-reactcache) for an example.

> **Good to know:** `React.cache` operates in an isolated scope inside `use cache` boundaries. See [React.cache isolation](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache#reactcache-isolation) for more information.

### Non-deterministic operations

Operations like `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or `crypto.randomUUID()` produce different values each time they execute. To ensure these run at request time (generating unique values per request), Cache Components requires you to explicitly signal this intent by calling these operations after dynamic or runtime data access.

```tsx
import { connection } from 'next/server'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

async function UniqueContent() {
  // Explicitly defer to request time
  await connection()

  // Non-deterministic operations
  const random = Math.random()
  const now = Date.now()
  const date = new Date()
  const uuid = crypto.randomUUID()
  const bytes = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16))

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{random}</p>
      <p>{now}</p>
      <p>{date.getTime()}</p>
      <p>{uuid}</p>
      <p>{bytes}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Because the `UniqueContent` component defers to request time, to use it within a route, it must be wrapped in `<Suspense>`:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    // <p>Loading..</p> is part of the static shell
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading..</p>}>
      <UniqueContent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Every incoming request would see different random numbers, date, etc.

> **Good to know**: You can cache non-deterministic operations with `use cache`. See the [with non-deterministic operations](#with-non-deterministic-operations) section for examples.

## Using `use cache`

The [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) directive caches the return value of async functions and components. You can apply it at the function, component, or file level.

Arguments and any closed-over values from parent scopes automatically become part of the [cache key](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache#cache-keys), which means different inputs produce separate cache entries. This enables personalized or parameterized cached content.

When [dynamic content](#dynamic-content) doesn't need to be fetched fresh from the source on every request, caching it lets you include the content in the static shell during prerendering, or reuse the result at runtime across multiple requests.

Cached content can be revalidated in two ways: automatically based on the cache lifetime, or on-demand using tags with [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) or [`updateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag).

> **Good to know**: See [serialization requirements and constraints](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache#constraints) for details on what can be cached and how arguments work.

### During prerendering

While [dynamic content](#dynamic-content) is fetched from external sources, it's often unlikely to change between accesses. Product catalog data updates with inventory changes, blog post content rarely changes after publishing, and analytics reports for past dates remain static.

If this data doesn't depend on [runtime data](#runtime-data), you can use the `use cache` directive to include it in the static HTML shell. Use [`cacheLife`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife) to define how long to use the cached data.

When revalidation occurs, the static shell is updated with fresh content. See [Tagging and revalidating](#tagging-and-revalidating) for details on on-demand revalidation.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight={1,4,5}
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')

  const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users')

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

The `cacheLife` function accepts a cache profile name (like `'hours'`, `'days'`, or `'weeks'`) or a custom configuration object to control cache behavior:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight={1,4-8}
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife({
    stale: 3600, // 1 hour until considered stale
    revalidate: 7200, // 2 hours until revalidated
    expire: 86400, // 1 day until expired
  })

  const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users')

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

See the [`cacheLife` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife) for available profiles and custom configuration options.

### With runtime data

Runtime data and [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) cannot be used in the same scope. However, you can extract values from runtime APIs and pass them as arguments to cached functions.

```tsx filename="app/profile/page.tsx"
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  // Page itself creates the dynamic boundary
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ProfileContent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

// Component (not cached) reads runtime data
async function ProfileContent() {
  const session = (await cookies()).get('session')?.value

  return <CachedContent sessionId={session} />
}

// Cached component/function receives data as props
async function CachedContent({ sessionId }: { sessionId: string }) {
  'use cache'
  // sessionId becomes part of cache key
  const data = await fetchUserData(sessionId)
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

At request time, `CachedContent` executes if no matching cache entry is found, and stores the result for future requests.

### With non-deterministic operations

Within a `use cache` scope, non-deterministic operations execute during prerendering. This is useful when you want the same rendered output served to all users:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'

  // Execute once, then cached for all requests
  const random = Math.random()
  const random2 = Math.random()
  const now = Date.now()
  const date = new Date()
  const uuid = crypto.randomUUID()
  const bytes = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16))

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {random} and {random2}
      </p>
      <p>{now}</p>
      <p>{date.getTime()}</p>
      <p>{uuid}</p>
      <p>{bytes}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

All requests will be served a route containing the same random numbers, timestamp, and UUID until the cache is revalidated.

### Tagging and revalidating

Tag cached data with [`cacheTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag) and revalidate it after mutations using [`updateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag) in Server Actions for immediate updates, or [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) when delays in updates are acceptable.

#### With `updateTag`

Use `updateTag` when you need to expire and immediately refresh cached data within the same request:

```tsx filename="app/actions.ts" highlight={1,4,5,13}
import { cacheTag, updateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getCart() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('cart')
  // fetch data
}

export async function updateCart(itemId: string) {
  'use server'
  // write data using the itemId
  // update the user cart
  updateTag('cart')
}
```

#### With `revalidateTag`

Use `revalidateTag` when you want to invalidate only properly tagged cached entries with stale-while-revalidate behavior. This is ideal for static content that can tolerate eventual consistency.

```tsx filename="app/actions.ts" highlight={1,4,5,12}
import { cacheTag, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getPosts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('posts')
  // fetch data
}

export async function createPost(post: FormData) {
  'use server'
  // write data using the FormData
  revalidateTag('posts', 'max')
}
```

For more detailed explanation and usage examples, see the [`use cache` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache).

### What should I cache?

What you cache should be a function of what you want your UI loading states to be. If data doesn't depend on runtime data and you're okay with a cached value being served for multiple requests over a period of time, use `use cache` with `cacheLife` to describe that behavior.

For content management systems with update mechanisms, consider using tags with longer cache durations and rely on `revalidateTag` to mark static initial UI as ready for revalidation. This pattern allows you to serve fast, cached responses while still updating content when it actually changes, rather than expiring the cache preemptively.

## Putting it all together

Here's a complete example showing static content, cached dynamic content, and streaming dynamic content working together on a single page:

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx"
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Static content - prerendered automatically */}
      <header>
        <h1>Our Blog</h1>
        <nav>
          <Link href="/">Home</Link> | <Link href="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>

      {/* Cached dynamic content - included in the static shell */}
      <BlogPosts />

      {/* Runtime dynamic content - streams at request time */}
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading your preferences...</p>}>
        <UserPreferences />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}

// Everyone sees the same blog posts (revalidated every hour)
async function BlogPosts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')

  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
  const posts = await res.json()

  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Latest Posts</h2>
      <ul>
        {posts.slice(0, 5).map((post: any) => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>
              By {post.author} on {post.date}
            </p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  )
}

// Personalized per user based on their cookie
async function UserPreferences() {
  const theme = (await cookies()).get('theme')?.value || 'light'
  const favoriteCategory = (await cookies()).get('category')?.value

  return (
    <aside>
      <p>Your theme: {theme}</p>
      {favoriteCategory && <p>Favorite category: {favoriteCategory}</p>}
    </aside>
  )
}
```

During prerendering the header (static) and the blog posts fetched from the API (cached with `use cache`), both become part of the static shell along with the fallback UI for user preferences.

When a user visits the page, they instantly see this prerendered shell with the header and blog posts. Only the personalized preferences need to stream in at request time since they depend on the user's cookies. This ensures fast initial page loads while still providing personalized content.

## Metadata and Viewport

`generateMetadata` and `generateViewport` are part of rendering your page or layout. During prerendering, their access to runtime data or uncached dynamic data is tracked separately from the rest of the page.

If a page or layout is prerenderable but only metadata or viewport accesses uncached dynamic data or runtime data, Next.js requires an explicit choice: cache the data if possible, or signal that deferred rendering is intentional. See [Metadata with Cache Components](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#with-cache-components) and [Viewport with Cache Components](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport#with-cache-components) for how to handle this.

## Enabling Cache Components

You can enable Cache Components (which includes PPR) by adding the [`cacheComponents`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) option to your Next config file:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" highlight={4} switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" highlight={3} switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

> **Good to know:** When Cache Components is enabled, `GET` Route Handlers follow the same prerendering model as pages. See [Route Handlers with Cache Components](/docs/app/getting-started/route-handlers#with-cache-components) for details.

## Navigation uses Activity

When the [`cacheComponents`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) flag is enabled, Next.js uses React's [`<Activity>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) component to preserve component state during client-side navigation.

Rather than unmounting the previous route when you navigate away, Next.js sets the Activity mode to [`"hidden"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity#activity). This means:

* Component state is preserved when navigating between routes
* When you navigate back, the previous route reappears with its state intact
* Effects are cleaned up when a route is hidden, and recreated when it becomes visible again

This behavior improves the navigation experience by maintaining UI state (form inputs, or expanded sections) when users navigate back and forth between routes.

> **Good to know**: Next.js uses heuristics to keep a few recently visited routes `"hidden"`, while older routes are removed from the DOM to prevent excessive growth.

## Migrating route segment configs

When Cache Components is enabled, several route segment config options are no longer needed or supported:

### `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`

**Not needed.** All pages are dynamic by default.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// Before - No longer needed
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export default function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// After - Just remove it
export default function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### `dynamic = "force-static"`

Start by removing it. When unhandled dynamic or runtime data access is detected during development and build time, Next.js raises an error. Otherwise, the [prerendering](#automatically-prerendered-content) step automatically extracts the static HTML shell.

For dynamic data access, add [`use cache`](#using-use-cache) as close to the data access as possible with a long [`cacheLife`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife) like `'max'` to maintain cached behavior. If needed, add it at the top of the page or layout.

For runtime data access (`cookies()`, `headers()`, etc.), errors will direct you to [wrap it with `Suspense`](#runtime-data). Since you started by using `force-static`, you must remove the runtime data access to prevent any request time work.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// Before
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

// After - Use 'use cache' instead
export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('max')
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### `revalidate`

**Replace with `cacheLife`.** Use the `cacheLife` function to define cache duration instead of the route segment config.

```tsx
// Before
export const revalidate = 3600 // 1 hour

export default async function Page() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// After - Use cacheLife
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### `fetchCache`

**Not needed.** With `use cache`, all data fetching within a cached scope is automatically cached, making `fetchCache` unnecessary.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// Before
export const fetchCache = 'force-cache'
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
// After - Use 'use cache' to control caching behavior
export default async function Page() {
  'use cache'
  // All fetches here are cached
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### `runtime = 'edge'`

**Not supported.** Cache Components requires Node.js runtime and will throw errors with [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/api-reference/edge).

************### Revalidating **********
# Caching and Revalidating
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


Caching is a technique for storing the result of data fetching and other computations so that future requests for the same data can be served faster, without doing the work again. While revalidation allows you to update cache entries without having to rebuild your entire application.

Next.js provides a few APIs to handle caching and revalidation. This guide will walk you through when and how to use them.

* [`fetch`](#fetch)
* [`cacheTag`](#cachetag)
* [`revalidateTag`](#revalidatetag)
* [`updateTag`](#updatetag)
* [`revalidatePath`](#revalidatepath)
* [`unstable_cache`](#unstable_cache) (Legacy)

## `fetch`

By default, [`fetch`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) requests are not cached. You can cache individual requests by setting the `cache` option to `'force-cache'`.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.jsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })
}
```

> **Good to know**: Although `fetch` requests are not cached by default, Next.js will [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching#static-rendering) routes that have `fetch` requests and cache the HTML. If you want to guarantee a route is [dynamic](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering), use the [`connection` API](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection).

To revalidate the data returned by a `fetch` request, you can use the `next.revalidate` option.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.jsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
}
```

This will revalidate the data after a specified amount of seconds.

You can also tag `fetch` requests to enable on-demand cache invalidation:

```tsx filename="app/lib/data.ts" switcher
export async function getUserById(id: string) {
  const data = await fetch(`https://...`, {
    next: {
      tags: ['user'],
    },
  })
}
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/data.js" switcher
export async function getUserById(id) {
  const data = await fetch(`https://...`, {
    next: {
      tags: ['user'],
    },
  })
}
```

See the [`fetch` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) to learn more.

## `cacheTag`

[`cacheTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag) allows you to tag cached data in [Cache Components](/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components) so it can be revalidated on-demand. Previously, cache tagging was limited to `fetch` requests, and caching other work required the experimental `unstable_cache` API.

With Cache Components, you can use the [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) directive to cache any computation, and `cacheTag` to tag it. This works with database queries, file system operations, and other server-side work.

```tsx filename="app/lib/data.ts" switcher
import { cacheTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('products')

  const products = await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
  return products
}
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/data.js" switcher
import { cacheTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheTag('products')

  const products = await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
  return products
}
```

Once tagged, you can use [`revalidateTag`](#revalidatetag) or [`updateTag`](#updatetag) to invalidate the cache entry for products.

> **Good to know**: `cacheTag` is used with [Cache Components](/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components) and the [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) directive. It expands the caching and revalidation story beyond `fetch`.

See the [`cacheTag` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag) to learn more.

## `revalidateTag`

`revalidateTag` is used to revalidate cache entries based on a tag and following an event. The function now supports two behaviors:

* **With `profile="max"`**: Uses stale-while-revalidate semantics, serving stale content while fetching fresh content in the background
* **Without the second argument**: Legacy behavior that immediately expires the cache (deprecated)

After tagging your cached data, using [`fetch`](#fetch) with `next.tags`, or the [`cacheTag`](#cachetag) function, you may call `revalidateTag` in a [Route Handler](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) or Server Action:

```tsx filename="app/lib/actions.ts" highlight={1,5} switcher
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function updateUser(id: string) {
  // Mutate data
  revalidateTag('user', 'max') // Recommended: Uses stale-while-revalidate
}
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/actions.js" highlight={1,5} switcher
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function updateUser(id) {
  // Mutate data
  revalidateTag('user', 'max') // Recommended: Uses stale-while-revalidate
}
```

You can reuse the same tag in multiple functions to revalidate them all at once.

See the [`revalidateTag` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) to learn more.

## `updateTag`

`updateTag` is specifically designed for Server Actions to immediately expire cached data for read-your-own-writes scenarios. Unlike `revalidateTag`, it can only be used within Server Actions and immediately expires the cache entry.

```tsx filename="app/lib/actions.ts" highlight={1,6} switcher
import { updateTag } from 'next/cache'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  // Create post in database
  const post = await db.post.create({
    data: {
      title: formData.get('title'),
      content: formData.get('content'),
    },
  })

  // Immediately expire cache so the new post is visible
  updateTag('posts')
  updateTag(`post-${post.id}`)

  redirect(`/posts/${post.id}`)
}
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/actions.js" highlight={1,6} switcher
import { updateTag } from 'next/cache'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function createPost(formData) {
  // Create post in database
  const post = await db.post.create({
    data: {
      title: formData.get('title'),
      content: formData.get('content'),
    },
  })

  // Immediately expire cache so the new post is visible
  updateTag('posts')
  updateTag(`post-${post.id}`)

  redirect(`/posts/${post.id}`)
}
```

The key differences between `revalidateTag` and `updateTag`:

* **`updateTag`**: Only in Server Actions, immediately expires cache, for read-your-own-writes
* **`revalidateTag`**: In Server Actions and Route Handlers, supports stale-while-revalidate with `profile="max"`

See the [`updateTag` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag) to learn more.

## `revalidatePath`

`revalidatePath` is used to revalidate a route and following an event. To use it, call it in a [Route Handler](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) or Server Action:

```tsx filename="app/lib/actions.ts" highlight={1} switcher
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

export async function updateUser(id: string) {
  // Mutate data
  revalidatePath('/profile')
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/actions.js" highlight={1} switcher
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

export async function updateUser(id) {
  // Mutate data
  revalidatePath('/profile')
```

See the [`revalidatePath` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) to learn more.

## `unstable_cache`

> **Good to know**: `unstable_cache` is an experimental API. We recommend opting into [Cache Components](/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components) and replacing `unstable_cache` with the [`use cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) directive. See the [Cache Components documentation](/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components) for more details.

`unstable_cache` allows you to cache the result of database queries and other async functions. To use it, wrap `unstable_cache` around the function. For example:

```ts filename="app/lib/data.ts" switcher
import { db } from '@/lib/db'
export async function getUserById(id: string) {
  return db
    .select()
    .from(users)
    .where(eq(users.id, id))
    .then((res) => res[0])
}
```

```jsx filename="app/lib/data.js" switcher
import { db } from '@/lib/db'

export async function getUserById(id) {
  return db
    .select()
    .from(users)
    .where(eq(users.id, id))
    .then((res) => res[0])
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight={2,11,13} switcher
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache'
import { getUserById } from '@/app/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ userId: string }>
}) {
  const { userId } = await params

  const getCachedUser = unstable_cache(
    async () => {
      return getUserById(userId)
    },
    [userId] // add the user ID to the cache key
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={2,7,9} switcher
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache'
import { getUserById } from '@/app/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { userId } = await params

  const getCachedUser = unstable_cache(
    async () => {
      return getUserById(userId)
    },
    [userId] // add the user ID to the cache key
  )
}
```

The function accepts a third optional object to define how the cache should be revalidated. It accepts:

* `tags`: an array of tags used by Next.js to revalidate the cache.
* `revalidate`: the number of seconds after cache should be revalidated.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight={6-9} switcher
const getCachedUser = unstable_cache(
  async () => {
    return getUserById(userId)
  },
  [userId],
  {
    tags: ['user'],
    revalidate: 3600,
  }
)
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={6-9} switcher
const getCachedUser = unstable_cache(
  async () => {
    return getUserById(userId)
  },
  [userId],
  {
    tags: ['user'],
    revalidate: 3600,
  }
)
```

****************### CSS **********************
# CSS
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


Next.js provides several ways to style your application using CSS, including:

* [Tailwind CSS](#tailwind-css)
* [CSS Modules](#css-modules)
* [Global CSS](#global-css)
* [External Stylesheets](#external-stylesheets)
* [Sass](/docs/app/guides/sass)
* [CSS-in-JS](/docs/app/guides/css-in-js)

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs.

Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
```

```bash package="npm"
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
```

Add the PostCSS plugin to your `postcss.config.mjs` file:

```js filename="postcss.config.mjs"
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

Import Tailwind in your global CSS file:

```css filename="app/globals.css"
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

Import the CSS file in your root layout:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import './globals.css'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import './globals.css'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Now you can start using Tailwind's utility classes in your application:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:** If you need broader browser support for very old browsers, see the [Tailwind CSS v3 setup instructions](/docs/app/guides/tailwind-v3-css).

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules locally scope CSS by generating unique class names. This allows you to use the same class in different files without worrying about naming collisions.

To start using CSS Modules, create a new file with the extension `.module.css` and import it into any component inside the `app` directory:

```css filename="app/blog/blog.module.css"
.blog {
  padding: 24px;
}
```

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
import styles from './blog.module.css'

export default function Page() {
  return <main className={styles.blog}></main>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/page.js" switcher
import styles from './blog.module.css'

export default function Layout() {
  return <main className={styles.blog}></main>
}
```

## Global CSS

You can use global CSS to apply styles across your application.

Create a `app/global.css` file and import it in the root layout to apply the styles to **every route** in your application:

```css filename="app/global.css"
body {
  padding: 20px 20px 60px;
  max-width: 680px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
// These styles apply to every route in the application
import './global.css'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
// These styles apply to every route in the application
import './global.css'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:** Global styles can be imported into any layout, page, or component inside the `app` directory. However, since Next.js uses React's built-in support for stylesheets to integrate with Suspense, this currently does not remove stylesheets as you navigate between routes which can lead to conflicts. We recommend using global styles for *truly* global CSS (like Tailwind's base styles), [Tailwind CSS](#tailwind-css) for component styling, and [CSS Modules](#css-modules) for custom scoped CSS when needed.

## External stylesheets

Stylesheets published by external packages can be imported anywhere in the `app` directory, including colocated components:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="container">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="container">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:** In React 19, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="..." />` can also be used. See the [React `link` documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/link) for more information.

## Ordering and Merging

Next.js optimizes CSS during production builds by automatically chunking (merging) stylesheets. The **order of your CSS** depends on the **order you import styles in your code**.

For example, `base-button.module.css` will be ordered before `page.module.css` since `<BaseButton>` is imported before `page.module.css`:

```tsx filename="page.tsx" switcher
import { BaseButton } from './base-button'
import styles from './page.module.css'

export default function Page() {
  return <BaseButton className={styles.primary} />
}
```

```jsx filename="page.js" switcher
import { BaseButton } from './base-button'
import styles from './page.module.css'

export default function Page() {
  return <BaseButton className={styles.primary} />
}
```

```tsx filename="base-button.tsx" switcher
import styles from './base-button.module.css'

export function BaseButton() {
  return <button className={styles.primary} />
}
```

```jsx filename="base-button.js" switcher
import styles from './base-button.module.css'

export function BaseButton() {
  return <button className={styles.primary} />
}
```

### Recommendations

To keep CSS ordering predictable:

* Try to contain CSS imports to a single JavaScript or TypeScript entry file
* Import global styles and Tailwind stylesheets in the root of your application.
* **Use Tailwind CSS** for most styling needs as it covers common design patterns with utility classes.
* Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles when Tailwind utilities aren't sufficient.
* Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS modules. For example, using `<name>.module.css` over `<name>.tsx`.
* Extract shared styles into shared components to avoid duplicate imports.
* Turn off linters or formatters that auto-sort imports like ESLint’s [`sort-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports).
* You can use the [`cssChunking`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cssChunking) option in `next.config.js` to control how CSS is chunked.

## Development vs Production

* In development (`next dev`), CSS updates apply instantly with [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh).
* In production (`next build`), all CSS files are automatically concatenated into **many minified and code-split** `.css` files, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for a route.
* CSS still loads with JavaScript disabled in production, but JavaScript is required in development for Fast Refresh.
* CSS ordering can behave differently in development, always ensure to check the build (`next build`) to verify the final CSS order.

# Image Optimization
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


The Next.js [`<Image>`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) component extends the HTML `<img>` element to provide:

* **Size optimization:** Automatically serving correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP.
* **Visual stability:** Preventing [layout shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls) automatically when images are loading.
* **Faster page loads:** Only loading images when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.
* **Asset flexibility:** Resizing images on-demand, even images stored on remote servers.

To start using `<Image>`, import it from `next/image` and render it within your component.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="" alt="" />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="" alt="" />
}
```

The `src` property can be a [local](#local-images) or [remote](#remote-images) image.

> **🎥 Watch:** Learn more about how to use `next/image` → [YouTube (9 minutes)](https://youtu.be/IU_qq_c_lKA).

## Local images

You can store static files, like images and fonts, under a folder called [`public`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

![Folder structure showing app and public folders](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/public-folder.png)

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
```

If the image is statically imported, Next.js will automatically determine the intrinsic [`width`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width-and-height) and [`height`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width-and-height). These values are used to determine the image ratio and prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls) while your image is loading.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'
import ProfileImage from './profile.png'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src={ProfileImage}
      alt="Picture of the author"
      // width={500} automatically provided
      // height={500} automatically provided
      // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided
      // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
    />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'
import ProfileImage from './profile.png'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src={ProfileImage}
      alt="Picture of the author"
      // width={500} automatically provided
      // height={500} automatically provided
      // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided
      // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
    />
  )
}
```

## Remote images

To use a remote image, you can provide a URL string for the `src` property.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
```

Since Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the [`width`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width-and-height), [`height`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width-and-height) and optional [`blurDataURL`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#blurdataurl) props manually. The `width` and `height` are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. Alternatively, you can use the [`fill` property](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#fill) to make the image fill the size of the parent element.

To safely allow images from remote servers, you need to define a list of supported URL patterns in [`next.config.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js). Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const config: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',
        search: '',
      },
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',
        search: '',
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


The Metadata APIs can be used to define your application metadata for improved SEO and web shareability and include:

1. [The static `metadata` object](#static-metadata)
2. [The dynamic `generateMetadata` function](#generated-metadata)
3. Special [file conventions](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) that can be used to add static or dynamically generated [favicons](#favicons) and [OG images](#static-open-graph-images).

With all the options above, Next.js will automatically generate the relevant `<head>` tags for your page, which can be inspected in the browser's developer tools.

The `metadata` object and `generateMetadata` function exports are only supported in Server Components.

## Default fields

There are two default `meta` tags that are always added even if a route doesn't define metadata:

* The [meta charset tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-charset) sets the character encoding for the website.
* The [meta viewport tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) sets the viewport width and scale for the website to adjust for different devices.

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

The other metadata fields can be defined with the `Metadata` object (for [static metadata](#static-metadata)) or the `generateMetadata` function (for [generated metadata](#generated-metadata)).

## Static metadata

To define static metadata, export a [`Metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object) from a static [`layout.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) or [`page.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) file. For example, to add a title and description to the blog route:

```tsx filename="app/blog/layout.tsx" switcher
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog',
  description: '...',
}

export default function Layout() {}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/layout.js" switcher
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog',
  description: '...',
}

export default function Layout() {}
```

You can view a full list of available options, in the [`generateMetadata` documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-fields).

## Generated metadata

You can use [`generateMetadata`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) function to `fetch` metadata that depends on data. For example, to fetch the title and description for a specific blog post:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
import type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'

type Props = {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}

export async function generateMetadata(
  { params, searchParams }: Props,
  parent: ResolvingMetadata
): Promise<Metadata> {
  const slug = (await params).slug

  // fetch post information
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.vercel.app/blog/${slug}`).then((res) =>
    res.json()
  )

  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.description,
  }
}

export default function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export async function generateMetadata({ params, searchParams }, parent) {
  const slug = (await params).slug

  // fetch post information
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.vercel.app/blog/${slug}`).then((res) =>
    res.json()
  )

  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.description,
  }
}

export default function Page({ params, searchParams }) {}
```

### Streaming metadata

For dynamically rendered pages, Next.js streams metadata separately, injecting it into the HTML once `generateMetadata` resolves, without blocking UI rendering.

Streaming metadata improves perceived performance by allowing visual content to stream first.

Streaming metadata is **disabled for bots and crawlers** that expect metadata to be in the `<head>` tag (e.g. `Twitterbot`, `Slackbot`, `Bingbot`). These are detected by using the User Agent header from the incoming request.

You can customize or **disable** streaming metadata completely, with the [`htmlLimitedBots`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/htmlLimitedBots#disabling) option in your Next.js config file.

Statically rendered pages don’t use streaming since metadata is resolved at build time.

Learn more about [streaming metadata](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#streaming-metadata).

### Memoizing data requests

There may be cases where you need to fetch the **same** data for metadata and the page itself. To avoid duplicate requests, you can use React's [`cache` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to memoize the return value and only fetch the data once. For example, to fetch the blog post information for both the metadata and the page:

```ts filename="app/lib/data.ts" highlight={5} switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import { db } from '@/app/lib/db'

// getPost will be used twice, but execute only once
export const getPost = cache(async (slug: string) => {
  const res = await db.query.posts.findFirst({ where: eq(posts.slug, slug) })
  return res
})
```

```js filename="app/lib/data.js" highlight={5} switcher
import { cache } from 'react'
import { db } from '@/app/lib/db'

// getPost will be used twice, but execute only once
export const getPost = cache(async (slug) => {
  const res = await db.query.posts.findFirst({ where: eq(posts.slug, slug) })
  return res
})
```

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
import { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'

export async function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: {
  params: { slug: string }
}) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.description,
  }
}

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
import { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'

export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.description,
  }
}

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

## File-based metadata

The following special files are available for metadata:

* [favicon.ico, apple-icon.jpg, and icon.jpg](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons)
* [opengraph-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image)
* [robots.txt](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots)
* [sitemap.xml](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap)

You can use these for static metadata, or you can programmatically generate these files with code.

## Favicons

Favicons are small icons that represent your site in bookmarks and search results. To add a favicon to your application, create a `favicon.ico` and add to the root of the app folder.

![Favicon Special File inside the App Folder with sibling layout and page files](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/favicon-ico.png)

> You can also programmatically generate favicons using code. See the [favicon docs](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons) for more information.

## Static Open Graph images

Open Graph (OG) images are images that represent your site in social media. To add a static OG image to your application, create a `opengraph-image.jpg` file in the root of the app folder.

![OG image special file inside the App folder with sibling layout and page files](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/opengraph-image.png)

You can also add OG images for specific routes by creating a `opengraph-image.jpg` deeper down the folder structure. For example, to create an OG image specific to the `/blog` route, add a `opengraph-image.jpg` file inside the `blog` folder.

![OG image special file inside the blog folder](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/opengraph-image-blog.png)

The more specific image will take precedence over any OG images above it in the folder structure.

> Other image formats such as `jpeg`, `png`, and `gif` are also supported. See the [Open Graph Image docs](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image) for more information.

## Generated Open Graph images

The [`ImageResponse` constructor](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response) allows you to generate dynamic images using JSX and CSS. This is useful for OG images that depend on data.

For example, to generate a unique OG image for each blog post, add a `opengraph-image.tsx` file inside the `blog` folder, and import the `ImageResponse` constructor from `next/og`:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx" switcher
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'
import { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'

// Image metadata
export const size = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
}

export const contentType = 'image/png'

// Image generation
export default async function Image({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      // ImageResponse JSX element
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'white',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        {post.title}
      </div>
    )
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.js" switcher
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'
import { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'

// Image metadata
export const size = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
}

export const contentType = 'image/png'

// Image generation
export default async function Image({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      // ImageResponse JSX element
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'white',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        {post.title}
      </div>
    )
  )
}
```

`ImageResponse` supports common CSS properties including flexbox and absolute positioning, custom fonts, text wrapping, centering, and nested images. [See the full list of supported CSS properties](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response).

> **Good to know**:
>
> * Examples are available in the [Vercel OG Playground](https://og-playground.vercel.app/).
> * `ImageResponse` uses [`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/og-image-generation), [`satori`](https://github.com/vercel/satori), and `resvg` to convert HTML and CSS into PNG.
> * Only flexbox and a subset of CSS properties are supported. Advanced layouts (e.g. `display: grid`) will not work.

*************### Route Handler****************
# Route Handlers
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


## Route Handlers

Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.

![Route.js Special File](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-special-file.png)

> **Good to know**: Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` directory. They are the equivalent of [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) inside the `pages` directory meaning you **do not** need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.

### Convention

Route Handlers are defined in a [`route.js|ts` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) inside the `app` directory:

```ts filename="app/api/route.ts" switcher
export async function GET(request: Request) {}
```

```js filename="app/api/route.js" switcher
export async function GET(request) {}
```

Route Handlers can be nested anywhere inside the `app` directory, similar to `page.js` and `layout.js`. But there **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route segment level as `page.js`.

### Supported HTTP Methods

The following [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`. If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.

### Extended `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` APIs

In addition to supporting the native [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs, Next.js extends them with [`NextRequest`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request) and [`NextResponse`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.

### Caching

Route Handlers are not cached by default. You can, however, opt into caching for `GET` methods. Other supported HTTP methods are **not** cached. To cache a `GET` method, use a [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.

```ts filename="app/items/route.ts" switcher
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,
    },
  })
  const data = await res.json()

  return Response.json({ data })
}
```

```js filename="app/items/route.js" switcher
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,
    },
  })
  const data = await res.json()

  return Response.json({ data })
}
```

> **Good to know**: Other supported HTTP methods are **not** cached, even if they are placed alongside a `GET` method that is cached, in the same file.

#### With Cache Components

When [Cache Components](/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components) is enabled, `GET` Route Handlers follow the same model as normal UI routes in your application. They run at request time by default, can be prerendered when they don't access dynamic or runtime data, and you can use `use cache` to include dynamic data in the static response.

**Static example** - doesn't access dynamic or runtime data, so it will be prerendered at build time:

```tsx filename="app/api/project-info/route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    projectName: 'Next.js',
  })
}
```

**Dynamic example** - accesses non-deterministic operations. During the build, prerendering stops when `Math.random()` is called, deferring to request-time rendering:

```tsx filename="app/api/random-number/route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    randomNumber: Math.random(),
  })
}
```

**Runtime data example** - accesses request-specific data. Prerendering terminates when runtime APIs like `headers()` are called:

```tsx filename="app/api/user-agent/route.ts"
import { headers } from 'next/headers'

export async function GET() {
  const headersList = await headers()
  const userAgent = headersList.get('user-agent')

  return Response.json({ userAgent })
}
```

> **Good to know**: Prerendering stops if the `GET` handler accesses network requests, database queries, async file system operations, request object properties (like `req.url`, `request.headers`, `request.cookies`, `request.body`), runtime APIs like [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies), [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers), [`connection()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection), or non-deterministic operations.

**Cached example** - accesses dynamic data (database query) but caches it with `use cache`, allowing it to be included in the prerendered response:

```tsx filename="app/api/products/route.ts"
import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'

export async function GET() {
  const products = await getProducts()
  return Response.json(products)
}

async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'
  cacheLife('hours')

  return await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
}
```

> **Good to know**: `use cache` cannot be used directly inside a Route Handler body; extract it to a helper function. Cached responses revalidate according to `cacheLife` when a new request arrives.

### Special Route Handlers

Special Route Handlers like [`sitemap.ts`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap), [`opengraph-image.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image), and [`icon.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons), and other [metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) remain static by default unless they use Dynamic APIs or dynamic config options.

### Route Resolution

You can consider a `route` the lowest level routing primitive.

* They **do not** participate in layouts or client-side navigations like `page`.
* There **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route as `page.js`.

| Page                 | Route              | Result                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `app/page.js`        | `app/route.js`     |  Conflict |
| `app/page.js`        | `app/api/route.js` |  Valid    |
| `app/[user]/page.js` | `app/api/route.js` |  Valid    |

Each `route.js` or `page.js` file takes over all HTTP verbs for that route.

```ts filename="app/page.ts" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}

// Conflict
// `app/route.ts`
export async function POST(request: Request) {}
```

```js filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}

// Conflict
// `app/route.js`
export async function POST(request) {}
```

### Route Context Helper

In TypeScript, you can type the `context` parameter for Route Handlers with the globally available [`RouteContext`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route#route-context-helper) helper:

```ts filename="app/users/[id]/route.ts" switcher
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(_req: NextRequest, ctx: RouteContext<'/users/[id]'>) {
  const { id } = await ctx.params
  return Response.json({ id })
}
```

> **Good to know**
>
> * Types are generated during `next dev`, `next build` or `next typegen`.

*******************### Proxy *******
# Proxy
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


## Proxy

> **Good to know**: Starting with Next.js 16, Middleware is now called Proxy to better reflect its purpose. The functionality remains the same.

Proxy allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

### Use cases

Some common scenarios where Proxy is effective include:

* Modifying headers for all pages or a subset of pages
* Rewriting to different pages based on A/B tests or experiments
* Programmatic redirects based on incoming request properties

For simple redirects, consider using the [`redirects`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/redirects) configuration in `next.config.ts` first. Proxy should be used when you need access to request data or more complex logic.

Proxy is *not* intended for slow data fetching. While Proxy can be helpful for [optimistic checks](/docs/app/guides/authentication#optimistic-checks-with-proxy-optional) such as permission-based redirects, it should not be used as a full session management or authorization solution.

Using fetch with `options.cache`, `options.next.revalidate`, or `options.next.tags`, has no effect in Proxy.

### Convention

Create a `proxy.ts` (or `.js`) file in the project root, or inside `src` if applicable, so that it is located at the same level as `pages` or `app`.

> **Note**: While only one `proxy.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your proxy logic into modules. Break out proxy functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `proxy.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific proxy, aggregated in the `proxy.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single proxy file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple proxy layers.

### Example

You can export your proxy function as either a default export or a named `proxy` export:

```ts filename="proxy.ts" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// Alternatively, you can use a default export:
// export default function proxy(request: NextRequest) { ... }

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

```js filename="proxy.js" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function proxy(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// Alternatively, you can use a default export:
// export default function proxy(request) { ... }

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

The `matcher` config allows you to filter Proxy to run on specific paths. See the [Matcher](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy#matcher) documentation for more details on path matching.
